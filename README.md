Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

Project Description:

The project involves developing a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model is trained on the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, which contains a large collection of movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a movie review based on its text content.

Key Activities:

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset by tokenizing the reviews, converting them to sequences, and padding them to a fixed length.
Model Development: Develop a sentiment analysis model using a neural network architecture, including an embedding layer, a flatten layer, and a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function.
Model Training: Train the model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Sentiment Analysis: Use the trained model to classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.
Data Loading: Load the name.basics.tsv and title.akas.tsv files from the IMDb dataset to extract additional information about the movies.
Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
TensorFlow: A popular open-source machine learning library used for building and training the sentiment analysis model.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API used for building the sentiment analysis model.
Pandas: A library used for data manipulation and analysis, including loading and preprocessing the IMDb dataset.
NumPy: A library used for numerical computations, including data preprocessing and model training.
IMDb Dataset: A large collection of movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
Tools and Frameworks:

Jupyter Notebook: A web-based interactive computing environment used for developing and testing the project.
Google Colab: A cloud-based platform used for running the project and accessing the IMDb dataset.
Deliverables:

Trained Sentiment Analysis Model: A trained model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a movie review based on its text content.
Model Evaluation Metrics: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall used to evaluate the model's performance.
Sentiment Analysis Function: A function that uses the trained model to classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.
Loaded IMDb Dataset: The loaded name.basics.tsv and title.akas.tsv files from the IMDb dataset.
